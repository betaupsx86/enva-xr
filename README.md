# Environment-Aware WebXR Augmented Reality

- Web-based framework for environment-aware rendering and interaction in augmented reality based on [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) using [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- The framework implements realistic rendering of 3D objects, handles with geometry occlusions, matches the lighting of the environment, casts shadows, and provides physics interaction with real-world objects.
- Target the web environment and have designed our solution to work on a vast range of devices as, monocular camera setups or devices with dedicated higher quality depth sensors.
- Single application while being capable of obtaining over 20 frames per second even on middle-range devices.
- [Demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFTV4o01338) of the features in the framework.
- Based on the experimental [WebXR AR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-ar-module/) draft  API available in Chrome 88+
  - [Lighting Estimation](https://immersive-web.github.io/lighting-estimation/)
  - [Depth Sensing Module](https://immersive-web.github.io/depth-sensing/)
  - [Hit Test Module](https://immersive-web.github.io/hit-test/)

### Getting Started

- Download the repository from git `gh repo clone tentone/ar-occlusion`
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- Prepare a browser compatible with WebXR in a depth with support for `depth-estimation`, `hit-test` and `lighting`.
- Install dependencies from NPM by running `npm install` and start the code running `npm run start`




### Algorithms

- To ensure consistency in the rendering of the virtual scene we implement a physically-based rendering pipeline.

- Physically correct attributes are associated with each 3D object that, combined with lighting information captured by the device, enables the rendering of AR content that matches the real-world illumination.

- Depth data provided by WebXR to dynamically place 3D objects around the environment, calculate geometry occlusion and build a model of the environment  to enable physics interaction.

- Calculate geometry occlusion on a pixel basis directly from the projected vertices coordinates to prevent loss in data precision

- To reuse the PBR pipeline of three.js we inject our code into the existing shaders generated by the library using the `onBeforeCompile` method of the material.
- We use the [cannon.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/) physics simulation engine for all physics interactions.
- The environment is mapped using a probabilistic voxel based model that is updated every frame.
